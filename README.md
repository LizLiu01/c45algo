# c45algo

Implementation of the C45 algorithm for generating decision trees

## Instructions

1. Run train_decision_tree.py. The output will generate two files: model/model.txt and tree.json
2. Evaluate the decision tree. Run test_decision_tree.py. The result output is in result/model_evaluation.csv

At the moment all parameters (Input train/test data and metadata) have been hardcoded to the iris dataset. This can be changed in the future
